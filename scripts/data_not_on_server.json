AngularJS is a client-side JavaScript web development framework where we believe we’ve done something special. We’ve approached the problem let’s say differently from the way any other JavaScript tool has before. Instead of asking what kind of functions we could provide to make writing apps smoother, we asked \"what if the browser worked differently in a way that eliminates code and gives structure to apps?\" This talk will take the audience on a tour of what the web platform of the future will look like and how the AngularJS framework can provide many of the powerful capabilities to existing browsers and bridge the path to web components, model driven views and other platform features that are currently being spec-ed.",

With WebGL it was different - my first contact with this technology was through a client project. I had to learn WebGL on the go. It took me a few months to actually start apperciating it, but once the project was over and I thought I know everything about it, I decided to write my own engine that I baptized simply J3D. After a good start, I realized I didn't know that much about WebGL after all... Since then I spent many day & nights (mostly nights) learning and creating what I believe is a good tool for other developers to start creating 3D applications in the browser. In my presentation I talk about specific challenges when working WebGL projects and how J3D addresses them. I will also take you on a short walk-through of it's features and present some demos.",

We've found the concepts translate well across of a variety of client projects, platforms, and frameworks, so much so that it's almost our de facto standard way to build frontends.\n\nWe also work on React projects that use Redux. Often the Redux code becomes a pain point that slows down the rest of the project. We've begun exploring using ReactiveX's javascript library, RxJS, as an alternative to Redux, and we'd like to share what we've learned.\n\nThis talk will provide:\n\n1. A general introduction to functional reactive programming.\n2. An introduction to ReactiveX libraries\n3. A broad comparison between ReactiveX and Redux\n",

But that looks too much for hosting one page, and I was really worry about scaling of it, we expected a huge peaks of load. And the final decision was to have AWS lambda render a page for us. \nSo the talk would be about SSR of React app in cloud functions (particularly aws lambda).",

      "description": "Despite solutions in many modern frameworks Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) still remains an elusive problem for web application security. While we have good and proven solutions it's not uncommon to still see these vulnerabilities in modern and legacy applications in use today. Typically this is due to the solutions not being utilized by the engineers, the application's framework not having support, or the engineers subverting the functionality to work around issues in the application. We'll take a deep dive into just how CSRF works followed by why the vulnerability class exists, and finally end demonstrating a solution that can be injected into any JavaScript frontend application to add support to existing applications.",
